  <p>APB or Adios Pantalones Brewing company has its origins dating back to a time when monks still used a stone mill
      to grind the hops. The brew was rinsed down the milky white thighs of virgin Portuguese nuns to seal its pure
      flavor. The founding fathers pulled in brew masters they knew would make an impact. Pro wrestlers they met on
      the Tijuana underground wrestling circuit.APB or Adios Pantalones Brewing company has its origins dating back to a
